# Resources to learn programming, probability, statistics, machine learning, and SQL
Here are some resources I've found particularly useful in learning about these topics. Aside from some of the books, all of the resources listed below are free.

## Computer Science and Programming
1. [MIT - 6.00.1x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-10)
2. [MIT - 6.00.2x: Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computational-thinking-data-mitx-6-00-2x-5#!)  
These are two courses from edX which will teach you fundamental computer science concepts and how to code in Python.
3. [Princeton - Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
4. [Princeton - Algorithms, Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)  
Two-part Coursera course on algorithms. Programming assignments are in Java. Challenging but worth the effort.  
5. [Stanford - Algorithms: Design and Analysis](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:Engineering+Algorithms1+SelfPaced/about)
6. [Stanford - Algorithms: Design and Analysis 2](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:Engineering+Algorithms2+SelfPaced/about)  
Another two-part course on algorithms covering similar topics as the Princeton one. You can use any programming language to complete the programming assignments.  
7. https://leetcode.com/  
There are hundreds of coding challenges to help you prepare for software engineering interviews. There are also SQL problems here.

## Probability and Statistics
1. [Stanford - Probability and Statistics](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:OLI+ProbStat+Open_Jan2017/about)  
Basic but solid introduction to probability and statistics from Stanford.
2. [MIT - 6.041x: Introduction to Probability - The Science of Uncertainty](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-probability-science-mitx-6-041x-2)  
If the first course was too easy for you, this should provide more of a challenge. Great edX MOOC on probability.
3. [A/B Testing](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257)  
A Udacity course on A/B testing, which is essentially applied hypothesis testing as used in data science.  
4. Statistics, 4th edition by D. Freedman, R. Pisani, and R. Purves, W. W. Norton and Company, 2007.  
Excellent book on statistics. Pretty basic at the beginning, but by the end you will be able to explain in plain English what confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and p values really are.
5. Naked Statistics by Charles Wheelan, W. W. Norton and Company, 2013.  
Nice, readable book on fundamental probability and statistics.

## Machine Learning
1. [Stanford - Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)  
Great accessible course on machine learning, from linear regression up to neural networks. You'll work with MATLAB/Octave.  
2. [Stanford - Statistical Learning](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about)  
Another great course on machine learning. Covers various regressions as well as topics like cross validation.
3. [MIT - 15.071x: The Analytics Edge](https://www.edx.org/course/analytics-edge-mitx-15-071x-3)  
Course covers many common machine learning algorithms, as well as linear programming. Also serves as a crash course on R.  
4. An Introduction to Statistical Learning by G. James, D. Witten, T. Hastie, and R. Tibshirani, Springer, 2014.  
Excellent introductory book on machine learning which is free online [here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). The above statistical learning MOOC is based off of this book.

## SQL
1. https://www.sqlteaching.com/  
If you are new to SQL, then this website gives you a quick, hands-on introduction to SQL. This can be completed in a few hours. No frills but is a good place to start.
2. http://sqlzoo.net/  
This is a good place to further improve your SQL skills. It has significantly more exercises than the one above.
3. [Stanford - Databases](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Home/Databases/Engineering/about)  
This MOOC from Stanford is a set of concise but comprehensive courses on databases. It is especially useful to learn about the theory of database design and to go beyond just querying databases in SQL.
